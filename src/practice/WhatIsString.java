     * Let's first understand what String in Java and how to create the String object.
     * String is basically an object.
     * There are two ways to create String object
     * 1.By String literal
     * 2.By new keyword
     *    -- String literal is created by using double quotes.For ex: String str = "Leyla";
     *    -- And by new keyword we will create new String object in a Heap memory. For ex: String str = new String();
     * Java String class provides many method length(); equals(); concat(); substring();
     *
     * And Why String is immutable? - String is immutable which means it can not be changed.Whenever we change any String ,
     * a new instance is created.
